This is a Sign Up page, created using React Js. I have created all standard error cases in this app, including: lower than 8 char error, invalid email error (the one which doesn't have @ and also .com), empty neccessary fields error and also previously used username error. If the user fills all needed fields correctly, a welcome page will appear which calls the name of user (firstName and lastName which the user is written) and welcomes the person.
